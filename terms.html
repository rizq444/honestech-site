      <h2>Terms &amp; Conditions</h2>
      <hr class="divider" />
      <p class="muted">Please read these terms before booking service with Honestech Mobile Mechanic Service.</p>

      <h3>1. Purpose</h3>
      <p>Honestech Mobile Mechanic Service (“Honestech”) provides convenient mobile vehicle maintenance and repair, and connects customers with trusted independent technicians as needed.</p>

      <h3>2. Independent Technicians</h3>
      <p>Technicians are independent contractors, not employees of Honestech. Each technician is responsible for the accuracy, quality, and completion of their work and assumes all liability related to services performed.</p>

      <h3>3. Customer Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>Please ensure the parts you purchase are correct for your vehicle (by VIN or verified year/make/model/engine). Provide a safe, accessible workspace suitable for mobile service.</p>

      <h3>4. Service Booking</h3>
      <p>Customers select a preferred date/time via the website. After review, Honestech will confirm the request and dispatch the job to an available technician if applicable.</p>

      <h3>5. Service Area &amp; Technician Assignment</h3>
      <p><strong>Middlesex County, NJ:</strong> When available, the owner of Honestech will personally perform the service. If unavailable, the job may be referred to a trusted independent technician.</p>
      <p><strong>Outside Middlesex County:</strong> Honestech will recommend and refer a trusted, approved independent technician who has agreed to Honestech’s quality and professionalism standards.</p>

      <h3>6. Pricing &amp; Payment</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Typical labor: $120 for the first hour, then $100 per hour thereafter (unless otherwise quoted).</li>
        <li>Payment is due upon completion and is made directly to the technician unless otherwise arranged.</li>
        <li>Stripe payments include a 3% processing fee.</li>
        <li>Roadside services outside Middlesex County: $1 per mile from the county line (when applicable).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>7. Additional Work / Upsells</h3>
      <p>If additional needs are identified during service, the technician will communicate before proceeding. Upsells may be handled privately between the technician and customer, or managed through Honestech for a 10% coordination fee.</p>

      <h3>8. Work Documentation</h3>
      <p>Technicians agree to take before-and-after photos (and short video if helpful) and provide copies to both the customer and Honestech within 24 hours of completion for quality and record-keeping.</p>

      <h3>9. Liability</h3>
      <p>All liability for workmanship and service rests with the technician performing the work. Honestech is a referral and scheduling service and is not liable for damages, injury, or loss arising from services performed.</p>

      <h3>10. Acknowledgment</h3>
      <p>By booking service, you acknowledge and agree to these terms, including the independent nature of technicians, your responsibility to provide correct parts, and the payment terms above.</p>
